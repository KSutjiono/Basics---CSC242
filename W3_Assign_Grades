//Using an array of size 100. write a program that reads student scores, 
//gets the best score, and then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
//Grade is A if score is > = best - 10;
//Grade is B if score is > = best - 20;
//Grade is C if score is > = best - 30;
//Grade is D if score is > = best - 40;
//Grade is F otherwise.
//The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then 
//prompts the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades.
