//Write a program that prompts the user to enter a five-digit integer and determines whether it is a 
//palindrome number. A number is palindrome if it reads the same from right to left and from left to right. 
//Here is a sample run of this program:
//Enter a five-digit integer: 13231
//13231 is a palindrome
//Enter a five-digit integer: 12366
//12366 is not a palindrome
//Note: The input for this program should be a single 5-digit integer 
//entered by the user, not five separate inputs.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    //Defining terms
    double n1, n2, n3, n4, sum, average;
    int count = 0;
    //Entering four values for sum and average
    cout << "Enter Num 1: ";
    cin >> n1;
    cout << "Enter Num 2: ";
    cin >> n2;
    cout << "Enter Num 3: ";
    cin >> n3;
    cout << "Enter Num 4: ";
    cin >> n4;
    //Calculating sum value and average
    sum = n1 + n2 + n3 + n4;
    average = sum / 4;
    cout << "The sum is: " << sum << endl;
    cout << "The Average is: " << average << endl;
    //Calculating how many numbers are above the average
    if (n1 > average) ++count;
    if (n2 > average) ++count;
    if (n3 > average) ++count;
    if (n4 > average) ++count;
    cout << count << " numbers are above average." << endl;
    return 0;}
