//Fayeâ€™s made-up problem
//Write a program that reads the length and the width of a rectangle
//and then calculates and displays the area of the rectangle. Here is a sample run:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
// explore integer division
  int a = 99;
  int b = 10;
  cout << a<< " / " << b <<" = " << a / b << endl;
// How to extract one's digit
  int a = 123459;
  cout << "The one's digit is " << a % 10 << endl;
//examples on cins and couts.
  //cout << "Hello to CSC242!"<<endl;
    double length;
    double width;
    //prompt the user to enter the length of the rectangle
      cout << "Please enter the length of your rectangle: ";
      cin >> length;
    //prompt the user to enter the width of the rectangle
      cout << "Please enter the width of your rectangle: ";
      cin >> width;
//cout << "The length is " << length << " and the width is " << width << endl;
double area;
area = length * width;
cout << "The area of the rectangle is " << area << endl;
cout << "Programming is fun!" << endl << endl << endl;
