//Write a program that estimates the value of the mathematical 
//constant e by using the following formula. Allow the 
//user to enter the number of terms to calculate.
//e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ....


//***ANSWER BELOW
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	//Enter values for n and e
	int n;
	long double e = 1.0;
	cout << "Enter n value: ";
	cin >> n;
	if (n < 0)
		cout << "Factorial of a negative number doesn't exist.";
	else
	{
		for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
			e += (1.0 / (i));
		//Output
		cout << "The value of e for " << n << " term(s) is: " << e;
	}
	return 0;
}


//FIX: "EACH TERM HAS A DENOMINATOR AS i! NOT JUST i."
//FIX: "THE RESULT IS NOT ACURATE BECAUSE THE TERM WAS
//FIX: NOT CORRRECTLY CALCULATED IN THE CODE"
