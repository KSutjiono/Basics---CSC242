//A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the 
//same length and all angles have the same degree 
//(i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). 
//The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is
//Area = (n * s^2) / [4 * tan (Pi / n)
//Pi = 3.14159265
//Here, s is the length of a side.
//Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of sides 
//and their length of a regular polygon and displays its area. 



//***ANSWER BELOW
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Prompt the user to enter the given information
    double sides, side, area, numerator, denominator;
    cout << "Enter the number of sides: ";
    cin >> sides;
    cout << "Enter the side: ";
    cin >> side;
    // Compute area
    numerator = sides * (side * side);
    denominator = 4 * tan(3.14159265 / sides);
    area = numerator / denominator;
    // Display result
    cout << "The area of the polygon is " << area;
    return 0;}
